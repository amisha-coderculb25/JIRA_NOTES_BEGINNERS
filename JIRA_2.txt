Day 2 – Jira Intermediate (Issues, Workflows, Filters)

Issue Types Deep Dive:
Issue = task/ticket to be tracked.
Main types: Task, Bug, Story, Epic.
 Each issue has a summary, Description, Assignee, Status, Priority.

Workflow:
A workflow defines the life cycle of an issue: "To Do" → "In Progress" → "Done".
You can customize workflows for different issue types in project settings.
Each status transition is called a "Transition" (e.g., "Start Progress", "Resolve Issue").

Filters:
Filters help you find specific issues fast.
You can use JQL (Jira Query Language) for custom searches.
Example: `assignee = currentUser() AND status != Done`

Boards:
Kanban: Continuous flow, best for ongoing work.
Scrum: Time-boxed sprints with planning and retrospectives.

What I Did Today:
Created multiple issue types (bug, story)
Customized a workflow: added “Code Review” status before “Done”
Tried JQL filters to find open issues assigned to me
