Day 3 – Jira Advanced: Sprint, Boards, Reports, Permissions

Sprint Setup (for Scrum projects):
- Create a backlog and drag tasks into a sprint.
- Start Sprint to track progress over a time frame (e.g., 1 or 2 weeks).
- During sprint: move issues through workflow (To Do → In Progress → Done).
- End sprint manually; incomplete tasks are moved to backlog or next sprint.

Board Configuration:
- Kanban and Scrum boards can be customized.
- Columns map to workflow statuses.
- Swimlanes and quick filters help focus on specific issue types or assignees.

Reports & Analytics:
- Velocity Chart: measures how much work was completed in past sprints.
- Burn-down Chart: visualizes remaining work in a sprint.
- Control Chart: shows cycle time and identifies bottlenecks.

User Roles & Permissions:
- Admin can manage users, assign roles, and define permissions per project.
- Roles include Administrator, Developer, Viewer, etc.
- Permissions control who can create/edit/transition issues.

What I did:
- Created a Scrum board and ran a test sprint.
- Explored velocity and burn-down reports.
- Reviewed project permission settings and roles.
